P.O.S is created and owned by themaninthemask but is allowed to be freely transformed and is mainly made to help beginners disect it and help them figure out how to use certain commands, this is not meant to be
used as an actual operating system and is meant to only be used for fun or for learning and is nowhere near completed.

anyway thank you for reading and good constructive criticism is very appreciated.
